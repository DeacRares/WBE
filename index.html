        Weapon balls elo rankings (WBER), is a NPO that is ranks every weaponball in <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/@Earclacks/featured" title = "Go to earclacks youtube chanel" target = "_blank">Earclack's</a> famous "Weapon Balls" series,
    using an <a href = 'engine code.html'>elo engine</a> to determine who is the best weapon ball. Those rankings only count 1v1s happening during the regular
    season the season end tournament, and doesnt count free for all, team events and block breaker.
    *note : In best of 3 matches I count each individula game so if a weaponball won 2-1 I count it as 2 wins and 1 loss 

        The rankings are updated every new upload, (last updated 8/9/2025), the current rankings are:
